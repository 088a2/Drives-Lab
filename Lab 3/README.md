Q.1. Understand switched mode power conversion.

Q.2. Simulate a Buck converter:
     - Vin = 220 V, Duty cycle = 50%, Switching frequency = 10 kHz
     - L = 100 mH, C = 100 µF, R = 22 Ω

Q.3. Simulate a Boost converter:
     - Vin = 220 V, Duty cycle = 50%, Period = 0.1 ms
     - L = 100 mH, C = 100 µF, R = 22 Ω

Open-Ended Exercise:
     - Buck-Boost converter, Vin = 150 V, Variable Vout = 100–200 V
     - L = 100 mH, C = 100 µF, R = 22 Ω, f = 10 kHz
     - Find duty range (40%–57.2%) and simulate till 5 sec.
